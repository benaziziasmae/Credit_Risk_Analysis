# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the project 

The purpose of this analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. 
We use Python to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk.
We adopted the following procedure:

- Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm.
- Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm.
- Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
